__DESIGN GOALS__

• aggressive simplicity
• zero external or internal dependencies
• small, flexible, reusable classes

__ASSUMPTIONS__

• iOS 5.0+
• ARC turned off
• UTF-8 string encoding end-to-end

__CLASSES__

JXOperation : NSOperation
• basic functionality for concurrent operations
• based heavily on http://www.dribin.org/dave/blog/archives/2009/05/05/concurrent_operations/

JXURLConnection : JXOperation
• adds a very light wrapper for NSURLConnection, handles run loop scheduling and counting bytes sent/received
• highly usable on its own when simplicity is paramount

JXHTTPOperation : JXURLConnection
• adds delegate callbacks, convenience methods for response data, and request body manipulation
• medium level of abstraction, direct manipulation of NSMutableURLRequest still possible

JXHTTPClient : NSObject
• unfinished, will eventually provide block callbacks and a private shared queue
• not a subclass of JXHTTPOperation, intended as a singleton controller object
• highest degree of abstraction available, more convenience methods planned

JXHTTPDelegate <NSObject>
• defines the callbacks available for delegates of JXHTTPOperation

JXHTTPRequestBody <JXHTTPDelegate>
• any class implementing this protocol can be a (POST/PUT) request body for JXHTTPOperation
• inherits from JXHTTPDelegate and receives the same delegate messages from the request
• compliant classes must be able to provide a fresh NSInputStream on demand (for retrying)

JXHTTPMultipartBody : NSObject <JXHTTPRequestBody>
• for multipart/form-data requests
• accepts data in the form of strings, raw data, or files
• files are streamed off disk through a buffer for maximum memory efficiency

JXHTTPFormEncodedBody : NSObject <JXHTTPRequestBody>
• for application/x-www-form-urlencoded requests
• accepts a dictionary of key/value pairs

JXHTTPJSONBody : NSObject <JXHTTPRequestBody>
• for application/json requests
• uses iOS 5.0 NSJSONSerialization

JXHTTPFileBody : NSObject <JXHTTPRequestBody>
• generic wrapper for request bodies already serialized to disk
• configurable content type

JXURLEncoding : NSObject
• provides URL and form encoding for strings and dictionaries
• improves on CFURLCreateStringByAddingPercentEscapes to make it compliant with RFC 3986
